It is June 13, 2022 and it marks the oficial [beginning][gsoc-timeline] of the
GSoC coding period. I have spent the last few weeks preparing the project and
organizing what my contributions will be. In addition to this blog, I have
created issues on the **[kw][kw]** GitHub page, and organized them on a project
[board][kw-board] and a [milestone][kw-milestone] which I'll be using to manage
my tasks and track my progress, and so can you!

In this first week I'll be focusing on integrating the prototype of the library
we'll use to access and download the lore archives, in other words, the back
end.
