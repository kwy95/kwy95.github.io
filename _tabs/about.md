My name is Rubens, and I'm software developer that recently graduated in
Computer Science at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. I'm passionate about Free and
Open Source Software and did my university [capstone project][tcc] helping
develop the *[Kernel Workflow][kw]* tool, which aims to create a unified and
simplified experience for the Linux kernel developer.

I currently work as a developer at a company called [PragmaCode][pragma] mostly
doing web development using Ruby on Rails. More relevantly to this blog, I'm
also a [GSoC][gsoc] contributor, where I'm continuing my work at **kw**, My
[project][gsoc-project] revolves around implementing an interface within this
tool to list and apply patches from the public mailing lists hosted on the
[lore][lore] platform.
